# Maze Generator

## About 
Maze Generator is a program, which uses the iterative implementation of 
the randomized depth-first search algorithm to generate a maze by removing the walls between adjacent cells. 
                                                                                                                                              
A path from the start cell to the end cell is then computed using the recursive depth-first search algorithm.                                                                                                                                                                                               
The graphics component of the program is handled by the pygame graphics library. Finally, a maze together with the path from start to end is drawn to the screen.
